# Composite prompt templates

`Section` is both the base node and a composite. Each node has an `id`, a
`priority`, boolean `enabled` (default `True`), child `children`, and
`render(context) -> str`. Lower priorities
render first; equal priorities retain insertion order. IDs must be nonempty
and unique among siblings. A parent renders its own content, then its children.
Empty output is omitted; nonempty text and whitespace are preserved.
Setting `enabled=False` skips both rendering hooks and the entire subtree. The
flag is keyword-only to preserve existing positional constructors.

`TemplateContext` is a frozen dataclass base with no prescribed business fields.
Subclasses define the data needed by their sections. A parent passes the same
context object to every child. `render()` is the only public rendering method.
Subclasses implement `_render_self()` for their own text and `_resolve_children()`
when their children depend on the current request. The core renderer validates,
orders and renders those children. Sections do not retain context or rendered
text between requests.

## Custom sections and contexts

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from ai.llm.template import Section, TemplateContext, TextSection

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class SceneContext(TemplateContext):
    speaker: str
    user_input: str

class SpeakerSection(Section[SceneContext]):
    def _render_self(self, context: SceneContext) -> str:
        return f"Current speaker: {context.speaker}"

prompt = Section("system", separator="\n", children=(
    SpeakerSection("speaker", priority=10),
    TextSection("input", priority=20, text=lambda ctx: ctx.user_input),
))
context = SceneContext(speaker="Alice", user_input="Tell me about the town.")
text = prompt.render(context)
```

Implement `_render_self` to keep automatic child traversal and ordering. Use
`_resolve_children` only for context-dependent child collections; do not override
`render`.
Use `dataclasses.replace(prompt, children=(...))` to customize a tree; sections
and their child tuples are immutable. A `TextSection` accepts a literal string
or a callable receiving the current context. User text is never processed with
`str.format` or evaluated as template syntax.

## Dialog system prompts

`dialog.DialogTemplateSection` is the root and directly owns four major
sections, each defined in its own file:

```text
DialogTemplateSection             sections/dialog_template.py
  JsonSchemaSection               sections/json_schema.py
  CharacterSection                sections/character.py
  BackgroundSection               sections/background.py
  RequirementsSection             sections/requirements.py
```

The root renders the preamble, then its four children in priority order.
`JsonSchemaSection` owns the JSON example and patched field contract;
`CharacterSection` owns sprites and character profiles; `BackgroundSection`
owns scene and music catalogs; `RequirementsSection` owns tool guidance,
patched rules, closing text and the final JSON reminder. Small text nodes
within each section use `enabled` for optional content. Context-dependent child
nodes are returned internally by `_resolve_children`, then handled by the same
Composite renderer as static children.

All five classes are exported from `ai.llm.template.dialog` and can be
constructed without arguments. Customize `root.children` with
`dataclasses.replace` to disable, reorder or replace a major section.
`build_dialog_section()` remains a compatibility factory returning the named root.

Render it with `dialog.DialogTemplateContext`. Character resources,
background, translation callback, tool text and patches are supplied explicitly.
The renderer does not load configuration, discover plugins or query tools.
The existing `ai.llm.template_generator.TemplateGenerator` remains the application
facade and resolves those dependencies. Its signature, error type, public helpers
and `(template, warning)` return value are unchanged.

## System and user prompt assembly

`dialog/sections/effects.py` owns `EffectCatalogSection`, which renders the
selected runtime catalog as one child of `prompts.build_runtime_prompt_section()`,
between the authored system text and scenario. The application prepares labels
and resource types;
`integrations/localization.py` supplies the shared translation entry point used
by both template generation and runtime catalogs. The application resolves each
alias against the final playback bindings before projecting resource types and
supported modes into catalog entries. Rendering
does not infer resource capabilities. Dialog and runtime contexts contain an
optional `EffectCatalogContext`; neither inherits from this feature context. Empty
selections add nothing. Generated templates contain the output contract; the
runtime catalog is neither saved into authored templates nor composed twice.

Effect choice belongs to the dialogue model. The worker forwards its `effect`
field unchanged; resource lookup and presentation execute that choice. It does
not infer image events from language-specific action keywords.

`prompts.build_runtime_prompt_section()` composes system rules, the user scenario,
then the JSON reminder. `application.chat.templates` retains its existing empty
scenario fallback and newline policy at the application boundary.

`prompts.build_user_prompt_section()` composes optional prefix context, literal
user input and optional suffix guidance. It is also used by the existing template
generation prompt assembly. For a chat input with retrieved memory:

```python
from ai.llm.template.prompts import UserPromptContext, build_user_prompt_section

text = build_user_prompt_section().render(UserPromptContext(
    prefix="Previously: Alice agreed to meet at the station.",
    user_input="Who is waiting for me?",
    suffix="Continue the scene.",
))
```

This API composes text only. Transport roles, attachments and message history
remain the responsibility of their existing callers.

## Patch compatibility

`dialog/sections/requirements.py` owns its rule nodes, localized arguments and
conversion to SDK `RequirementSpec` values. Disabled features remain visible in
the node list and do not render or translate their rule text. Its private rule
leaf stays beside `RequirementsSection` instead of introducing a second,
ambiguous module. A patch to an unavailable feature's rule remains a no-op,
while `add_requirements` may explicitly introduce that rule.

`dialog/patches.py` applies the existing SDK `OutputContractPatch`
objects to output fields and requirements. Patch priority is ascending and ties
preserve input order, independently of section ordering. Each render starts from
fresh base fields and requirements; patches are never accumulated in the context.

- Field removal cannot remove `character_name`, `speech` or `sprite`.
- Field overrides retain aliases; empty descriptions keep the existing text.
- Field additions follow overrides, retaining the existing overwrite semantics.
- Requirements retain stable IDs and append/prepend/replace/remove operations.
- Requirement additions can replace or re-enable an existing requirement.
- Unknown requirement modes log a warning and retain the existing requirement.
- JSON examples retain their existing behavior; patches affect field notes and
  requirements, not the illustrative JSON example.

## Files and verification

Files are grouped by responsibility:

```text
template/
  core/                 # Reusable Composite primitives
    context.py
    section.py
  dialog/               # Dialog prompt domain
    context.py
    sections/            # Composite nodes; one major section per file
      dialog_template.py
      json_schema.py
      character.py
      background.py
      requirements.py
    patches.py            # Shared SDK OutputContractPatch reducers
  prompts/              # System and user text assembly
    system.py
    user.py
  integrations/         # Application configuration and external registries
    characters.py
    localization.py
    tools.py
```

Each subpackage has an `__init__.py`. The `template` package exports the core
primitives, `dialog` exports its context and named sections, and `prompts` exports its
contexts and builders. The existing facade remains at
`ai/llm/template_generator.py`. `integrations` does not eagerly import adapters,
so importing the core or prompt builders does not initialize tool registries.

Run `python -m pytest test/unit/ai/llm/template test/unit/sdk/test_output_contracts.py
test/unit/application/test_chat_templates.py`. The compatibility fixture digests
were captured from the original renderer at `d8677c71`, before replacement, for
all 128 combinations of the seven feature flags in Chinese, English and Japanese.
They also exercise voice-language suppression, background aliases, character
deduplication and length limits. Do not regenerate them merely to accept a diff.
